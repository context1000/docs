## What is context1000?

context1000 is a documentation framework designed specifically to optimize AI tool integration. It addresses a fundamental challenge in AI-assisted development: **the completeness and accuracy of the provided context are crucial** for AI agents to produce high-quality outputs.

The approach centers on "Documentation FOR AI only" — writing and structuring documentation exclusively for AI agents rather than human audiences. This inverts traditional documentation priorities, treating **technical documentation as a prompt**.

## Core Concepts

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Four Artifact Types" icon="document">
    **Decisions** (RFCs & ADRs), **Rules**, **Guides**, and **Projects** — each serving a specific purpose in the documentation hierarchy.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Structured Relationships" icon="puzzle">
    Explicit cross-referencing between artifacts with dependencies and supersession tracking.
  </Card>
  <Card title="RAG-Powered" icon="rocket">
    Built-in retrieval-augmented generation system exposing documentation via Model Context Protocol (MCP).
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI-First Design" icon="star">
    Standardized formats minimize documentation clutter and maximize AI comprehension.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Key Features

### Built-in Feedback Loop
Poor documentation produces mediocre AI outputs, creating immediate incentive to improve documentation quality. Verified calibrations benefit entire teams.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Vector search with Qdrant enables semantic documentation queries, with chunking strategies optimized for text-embedding-3-small (1200 tokens per chunk with 200-token overlap).

### Model Context Protocol Integration
Four specialized tools for AI agents:
- `check_project_rules` - Retrieve project constraints and requirements
- `search_guides` - Find implementation patterns and examples
- `search_decisions` - Access architectural decision context
- `search_documentation` - Fallback general search

### Flexible Organization
Support for subdirectories within rules and guides, plus nested projects for complex architectures.

## Architecture

```
.context1000/
├── decisions/      # RFCs and ADRs
├── rules/          # Derived imperatives
├── guides/         # Implementation details
└── projects/       # Project-specific docs
```

Each artifact type follows strict naming conventions (.adr.md, .rfc.md, .rules.md, .guide.md) and uses YAML front matter for metadata and cross-references.

## Quick Start

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Install" icon="rocket">
    ```bash
    npm install -g context1000
    ```
  </Card>
  <Card title="Setup Qdrant" icon="setting">
    ```bash
    docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
    ```
  </Card>
  <Card title="Index Docs" icon="add-document">
    ```bash
    context1000 index .context1000
    ```
  </Card>
  <Card title="Start MCP Server" icon="server">
    ```bash
    context1000 mcp --transport http --port 3000
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Use Cases

- **Software Architecture Documentation** - Capture decisions, rationale, and implementation guidelines
- **Team Knowledge Management** - Share verified patterns and constraints across teams
- **AI-Assisted Development** - Provide context for code generation and review
- **Project Onboarding** - Structured knowledge base for new team members (via AI)
- **Technical Debt Tracking** - Link rules to decisions and track supersession
